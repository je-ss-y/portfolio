            <h3>About me </h3>
            <p>part of me is down to earth ,another part is a dreamer.</p>
            <p>As long as i can remember, i have always wondered what would i be if i wasn't the way i am.
                Not to be someone else , but rather everything that i can be. from the good to the bad ,to the ugly.
                The ambiguity is considered immature in most parts of our society, i have found in the unknown the beauty of creation.
                my personnality have always driven me to different choices, starting of as a student and future worker in the creative industry,
                i found from there the beauty in programming.
                coding for me, because it's beautiful , a language that creates anything you can imagine . To create is why i'm in the industry.
